### Goal

<!-- Write the goal of the task. The goal:
- must be verifiable,
- must be a brief sentence,
- may assume prior knowledge

Verifiability means that there is a concrete way to check task completion, e.g., by starting the app and checking a feature or reading a piece of new documentation, looking at a screenshot of a new / changed thing, ...

An example of an unverifiable goals is: "Improve performance of the app" -> what does a performance improve mean? Faster loading times? How much faster? Smaller application size? How much smaller?

An example of a verifiable goal is: "Reduce initial loading time of the application to reactivity in Chrome to 200 milliseconds."

-->

### Context

<!-- Write the context of the task. This may be arbitrarily long and **must not** assume prior knowledge. You should explain novel technical concepts, customer requirements, backgrounds, ... as required for task completion. This should be understandable by anyone with basic project knowledge. -->

### Tasks

<!-- Add the concrete sub-tasks that must be completed to reach the goal of the task. Each sub-task should either be a markdown checkbox for a completable, concrete sub-task X (`- [ ] X`) or a bullet for information X (`- X`) -->
