REMOVE THIS!

What are the different sections for?

1. Goal?
Write the goal of the task. The goal:
- must be verifiable,
- must be a brief sentence,
- may assume prior knowledge

This section is required.

2. Context?

Write the context of the task. This may be arbitrarily long and **must not** assume prior knowledge. You should explain novel technical concepts, customer requirements, backgrounds, ... as required for task completion. This should be understandable by anyone with basic project knowledge.

This section is optional.

3. Tasks?

Add the concrete sub-tasks that must be completed to reach the goal of the task. Each sub-task should either be a markdown checkbox for a completable, concrete sub-task X (`- [ ] X`) or a bullet for information X (`- X`)

This section is required.
